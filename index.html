<h1>About</h1>

<p>I am a PhD candidate in the <a href="http://www.scs.gatech.edu/">School of Computer Science</a> at <a href="http://www.gatech.edu">Georgia Tech</a>. I work in the Software Engineering group under the supervision of <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~orso/">Dr. Alex Orso</a>. My research goal is to improve the testing and maintenance of modern software applications across multiple platforms. In the past, I have also worked on improved penetration testing for web applications.</p> 

<p>In 2012, I was awarded the <a href="http://tiger.gatech.edu">TI:GER fellowship</a>, which changed my focus towards commercializing my research. Under this program, I have created <a href="http://checkdroid.com">CheckDroid</a>, which is a service to help Android developers test their applications across different mobile devices.</p> 

<p>Over the past few years, I have also worked at several companies including <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> ('11), <a href="http://www.flacp.fujitsulabs.com/TSIG/">Fujitsu Labs of America</a> ('11), <a href="http://yahoo.com">Yahoo!</a> ('10), <a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/irl/">IBM Research</a> ('09), <a href="http://www.gs.com">Goldman Sachs</a> ('08) and <a href="http://www.hsbcglt.com/">HSBC Software</a>. </p>
